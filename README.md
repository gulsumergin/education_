This project is a simple website for Aykin Bildungsberatung. The website includes a homepage, an about us page, a services page, and a contact us page.
The homepage features a jumbotron with a background image of Germany and a call-to-action button to learn more about studying in Germany. 
The about us page provides information about the company and its mission.
The services page lists the different services offered by Aykin Bildungsberatung, such as university selection, visa assistance, and accommodation finding.
The contact us page includes a form that users can fill out to get in touch with the company.

In this code, the action attribute of the form is set to the Formspree endpoint https://formspree.io/f/xayrvgwd. When the user submits the form, Formspree will send an email to the specified email address with the form data.

To use Formspree in your own project, you can follow these steps:

Go to the Formspree website (https://formspree.io/) and sign up for an account.
Create a new form and copy the Formspree endpoint.
Add a form to your website with the Formspree endpoint in the action attribute.
Test the form by submitting it and checking your email for the form data.

Note: Formspree has a free plan that allows you to receive up to 50 submissions per month.
